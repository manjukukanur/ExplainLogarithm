## Deployment to Streamlit Community Cloud

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository
1. Sign up for a GitHub account if you don't have one
2. Create a new repository
3. Push all your code to this repository

### Step 2: Create requirements.txt
Create a file named `requirements.txt` in your GitHub repository with the following content:

streamlit==1.31.0
numpy==1.24.3
pandas==2.0.3
matplotlib==3.7.2
plotly==5.18.0

### Step 3: Deploy to Streamlit Cloud
1. Go to https://share.streamlit.io/
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. Click "New app"
4. Select your repository, branch, and enter the path to your app.py file
5. Click "Deploy"

### File Structure Check
Make sure your GitHub repository has the following structure:
- .streamlit/
  - config.toml
- pages/
  - 1_Introduction.py
  - 2_Visualizations.py
  - 3_Real_World_Applications.py
  - 4_Interactive_Calculators.py
  - 5_Quiz.py
- utils/
  - logarithm_utils.py
- app.py
- requirements.txt

### Important Notes
- Streamlit Community Cloud supports Python 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11
- Your app will be publicly accessible once deployed
- You get limited compute resources on the free tier, but it should be sufficient for this educational app
- Streamlit will automatically handle the installation of dependencies listed in requirements.txt
